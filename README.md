## Abstract: 
This project implements the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm, a cryptographic protocol that enables secure key exchange between two parties over an insecure communication channel. The algorithm generates a shared secret key using public and private key pairs, ensuring secure communication without actually exchanging the keys. The project demonstrates the application of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm in secure communication and key exchange.
